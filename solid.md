1. SRP:(Single Reponsibility Principle)

   - A class should have only one reason to change.
   - Seperation of concerns - different classes handling different , independent tasks/problems

2. OCP:(Open Closed Principle)

   - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. LSP:(Liskov Substituion Principle)

   - Should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.

4. Interface Segregation Principle:
   - Dont put too much into an interface ; split into seperate interfaces.
   - YAGNI :- you aint gonna need it .

5. Dependency Inversion Principle:
    - High level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions.
