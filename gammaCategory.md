# Gamma Categorization 
1. Design Patterns are typically split into 3 categories.

2. This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.

3. Creational Patterns:
    - Deal with the creation(construction) of objects.
    - Explicit(constructor) vs. implicit(DI,reflection,etc.)
    - Wholesale(single stmt) vs piecewise(step-by-step) intialization 

4. Structural Patterns:
    - Concerned with the structure.(eg: class members)
    - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
    - Stress the importance of good API design.

5. Behavioural Patterns:
    - They are all different, no central theme.
