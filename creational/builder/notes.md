- Some Objects are simple and can be created in a single intiailizer call.
- Other Objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
- Build out the objects in stages.
- Having a object with 10 initializer arguments is not productive.
- Instead, opt for piecewise construction.
- Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.

**Builder** :- When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succintly.
